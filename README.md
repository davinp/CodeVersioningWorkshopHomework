# CodeVersioningWorkshopHomework
Code versioning workshop Davin

This is just a test version

My summary understanding about branching is:
- Branch is created as a copy/separate version of original branch
- With git branch, we can make new changes in a local branch without impacting the main branch

The command generally used in branching:
- git branch (To create, edit and delete the branch)
- git checkout (To checkout branch and make some changes in the branch)

Summary of Merging topics from the last workshop:
- Commit is used to stage any changes made in local branch before merging it to main branch
- Pushing the branch means that the codes are going to be submitted to origin review and ready to be reviewed

Git command for merging:
- git commit (to stage the changes applied in local branch)
- git push (to push the changes in local branch to remote branch and make it ready to be reviewed by another collaborator)

Open Pull Request
Create pull request in the remote repository and make it available for review

Challenge:
- misfocus with salary increase announcement from Oliver :)
- couldn't get the access (permission denied) to the material

How I overcome the challenge is trying my best to remember what are presented during the workshop
