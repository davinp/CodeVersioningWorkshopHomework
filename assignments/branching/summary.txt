My summary understanding about branching is:
- Branch is created as a copy/separate version of original branch
- With git branch, we can make new changes in a local branch without impacting the main branch

The command generally used in branching:
- git branch (To create, edit and delete the branch)
- git checkout (To checkout branch)
